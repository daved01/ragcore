Installation
***************

Before you start, make sure you have at least Python 3.10 installed. Then, you can use `pip` to install


.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ragcore


Alternatively, you can clone the repository and build from source:


.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/daved01/ragcore.git
    cd ragcore
    pip install .

You can check if the installation was successful by running

.. code-block:: bash

    ragcore -h

You should see some information about ``ragcore``.

Now you can start building your Retrieval-Augmented Generation application! 
If you want to develop on ``ragcore``, see section :ref:`develop` for setup and installation instructions.
